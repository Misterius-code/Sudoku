<h1 align="center"> Sudoku Solver </h1> <br>
Very light Sudoku solver which generates a random board and then uses backtracing methods to solve it self. Project was designed to work on CMD instead of GUI as interface would simply double the size of the file. Project is written in Python and uses recursive backtracking method.Sudoku also show what is the current number it is trying to solve and how many tires it already has.

<h1 align="center"> Sudoku Test</h1> <br>
I tested sudoku on 5000 different boards to see how many tries it takes to finish the board. The results were interesting because it approximately around 31610 tries to solve board.

<h1 align="center">Feature Updates/h1> <br>

I have in mind few improvements to this software which could make it an even better projects. Definitely a good improvement would be to add other methods of solving sudoku , creating GUI and optimize code.
